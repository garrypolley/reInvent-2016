# Vendor conversations

Notes from talks with vendors on the swag floor.

## Alert Logic

We had an okay chat with these folks.  It seems like their goal
is to alert on a lot of different options. Seems they can combine
some alert features, but for our needs they don't provide anything
new.  Unlikely we'd use them. Further, as you'll read with big
Panda, Alert Logic isn't needed with Big Panda.


## Big Panda

We chatted with a guy named David for awhile about the background of Big Panda.
It is an interesting company founded by some folks that used to work in counter
terrorism from a coding standpoint.

They have a few folks that are working out of Overland Park and this guy often
comes to the KC area because of family ties. He wanted to chat with us in two
weeks when he is in KC.

As for the product itself it seems really great. It'll correlate logs and information
into one incident. It does some algorithmic work to correlate logs when an event happens
across your entire system. It integrates with just about everything we have in our system.
