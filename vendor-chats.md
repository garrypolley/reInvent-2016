# Vendor conversations

Notes from talks with vendors on the swag floor.

## Alert Logic

We had an okay chat with these folks.  It seems like their goal
is to alert on a lot of different options. Seems they can combine
some alert features, but for our needs they don't provide anything
new.  Unlikely we'd use them. Further, as you'll read with big
Panda, Alert Logic isn't needed with Big Panda.


## Big Panda

We chatted with a guy named David for awhile about the background of Big Panda.
It is an interesting company founded by some folks that used to work in counter
terrorism from a coding standpoint.

They have a few folks that are working out of Overland Park and this guy often
comes to the KC area because of family ties. He wanted to chat with us in two
weeks when he is in KC.

As for the product itself it seems really great. It'll correlate logs and information
into one incident. It does some algorithmic work to correlate logs when an event happens
across your entire system. It integrates with just about everything we have in our system.

## Raygun

They seemed excited to chat and a little over eager. They provide a service that seems to be
exactly what Sentry does. Mentioned that getting source maps for JavaScript would work well.
They also had a GO SDK that may be wroth looking into. They do crash reporting.

## Check Point

They are a security company. It seem like they do IPS and IDS for networking and hosts.
They seemed to have all the things when it comes to seetting up automated security.
They've been around for 17 years.

## CoreOS

They provide managed kubernetes for almost all the clouds. They also have a cool souding management
console for putting all things together for deployments and containers.

## Bracket

They provide OS level security monitoring. They run at ring 0 with the host OS. Seemed kind of invasive
because they run at the OS level and need to backed into an AMI from the get go. They also provided
A key managment service and would make it easier to do cross region replication of a database because
the key is not tied to the cloud provider.

## Protectwise

They are also a security company. Provide some network security. Their goal is to alert you if there
is suspsicious activity on your network. They some cool dashboards for looking into possible intrusions.
