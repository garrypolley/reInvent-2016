Datetime: Tuesday, November 29th, 2016

## Goal before

* Learn ore use cases for work spaces
* Learn how to setup new work spaces
* Learn why I'd want work spaces over a VM
* Learn if it's possible to replace a traditional desktop with these work spaces

## Preview/Overview

* Talk about security
* What you'd use it for
* Talk about the failed promises of on-premises VDI
* Capabilities
* Overview
* Key benefits
* Stories of users

## What's the motivation to use

* Admins:
  * Securing resources
  * Lowering cost structure
  * Ease to administrate the machines
* Users:
  * Instant access
  * On any device


### On pre-VDI

* High expense
* Hard to scale
* Specialized resources -- better spent on company specific needs rather than using individual devices


### Desktop AWS -- features

* Pay as you go
* Desktop is secure because it's sent over AES encryption
* Encrypted at rest and in transit
* Should have fast internet on the machine
* Only pay for licenses that get used, don't worry about having a lot of them
* Monitors the desktop for you
* No data leaves your workspace because it's in the "cloud"

### Use cases

* Knowledge Workers - bring your own device
* Merges and acquisitions
* mobile Workers
* Temporary Workers
* Securing data
* Dev/Test
* Compliance requirements
* Call Centers
* Training and labs
* Developers -- I'll need to see this example, my mac is pretty good so far

### Benefits

* Much easier to do deployments of the "devices"
* Cloud watch monitoring for your devices
* Physical and virtual deployments are simplified
* Does well with existing stuff
  * Active Directory
  * Intranet
  * MFA
  * SCCM (I've no idea what this is...)
* Billing options:
  * Monthly
  * Hourly
