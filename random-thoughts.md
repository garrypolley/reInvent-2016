* Seems like IoT devices may do best with Lambda integrations
* Big Panda may be the coolest thing for incident management
* AWS API Gatemway seems like something I should be using
* May be able to use this new Lex services for call center logs
* Can the image processor read what's in the PDF invoice files?
* Maybe create a skill for cooking, e.g. recipes and telling you what to do for it
