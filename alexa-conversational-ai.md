# Alexa conversational AI

Goal of Alexa was to have a computer that would do what you wanted
based on your voice. They chose voice because it's how humans naturally
communicate. It's one of the best UX you can have.

They wanted to focus on voice to limit the number of devices you have
to mess with to complete tasks. No clutter when using your voice.

## Processing for voice

* Three choices: Amazon, Echo, and Alexa are start words
* Only sends to cloud once it's sure it has gotten a start word
* 7 microphones to determine where the talk is happening

### Breaks the processing into:

* Speech recognition
* Intent
* Shuffle
* Then good text to voice so it sounds good

## Data driven "deep learning"

* Use S3
* EC2 Hosts and GPU based hosts

## Alexa for developers

* Alexa skill kit -- you can add a new one by making a skill
* Alexa voice service -- hardware manufacturers can use it in their hardware
* Smarthome API that makes it easy for Alexa
* Alexa Fund gives money to people innovating with voice

## Skill building

* Will need to spend some time to build out a skill's variations
* Developer preview for built-in library to make above note easier
* Will have domains for intents and slot types built out

## Intel

* Intel based smart home hub
* Controls 26 different devices within the tiny home
* There are skills for setting up experiences
* ODEM Cybertan for the hub
* Intel is releasing their first form factor reference design for Alexa based hardware
